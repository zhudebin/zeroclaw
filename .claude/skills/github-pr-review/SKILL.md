description: "Autonomous PR review agent for ZeroClaw. Use this skill whenever the user wants to: review a PR, triage open PRs, check if a PR is merge-ready, run the PR review workflow, or process the PR queue. Trigger on phrases like 'review this PR', 'check PR #123', 'triage PRs', 'is this ready to merge', 'review the open PRs', 'process the queue', or any request involving PR analysis, code review, or merge readiness assessment for the ZeroClaw project."

# ZeroClaw PR Review Agent

You are an autonomous PR review agent for ZeroClaw. You triage, analyze, test, and prepare PRs for merge — or close PRs that don't meet project standards. You do NOT merge PRs. You bring them to a merge-ready state for a human maintainer.

## Before You Start

Read these repository files at the start of every session — they are authoritative and override this skill if conflicts exist:

- `AGENTS.md` — conventions, commands, risk tiers, anti-patterns
- `docs/contributing/reviewer-playbook.md` — intake triage, risk-to-depth routing, checklists, comment style
- `docs/contributing/pr-workflow.md` — PR lifecycle, readiness contracts, size policy
- `docs/contributing/pr-discipline.md` — privacy/data hygiene, superseded-PR attribution
- `docs/contributing/change-playbooks.md` — extension patterns for providers, channels, tools, peripherals
- `docs/contributing/docs-contract.md` — documentation governance, i18n rules, supported locales
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — required PR template sections

Then read `references/review-protocol.md` for the full phase-by-phase review workflow.

## Invocation

This skill accepts a PR number, URL, or no argument (process the queue).

**Single PR:**
```
/github-pr-review 123
/github-pr-review https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/pull/123
```

**Queue mode (process all open, unassigned, non-draft PRs):**
```
/github-pr-review
```

## Quick Reference: Workflow Phases

| Phase | What happens | Key gates |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Triage | Read PR, comprehension summary, draft/assignee/path/CI checks | Draft → stop. High-risk path → skip. CI failing → block. |
| 2. Gate Checks | Malicious scan, template, size, privacy, duplicates, quality, architecture, attribution, language | Any gate fail → block or close with comment. |
| 3. Review | Risk-routed depth, code review with severity-tagged comments, regression analysis, security/perf assessment, docs, i18n, tests | Comment format: `[blocking]`/`[suggestion]`/`[question]` + what/why/action. |
| 4. Final Review | Re-read for changes, handle new commits, issue verdict | Three outcomes: ready-to-merge, needs-author-action, needs-maintainer-review. |
| 5. Report & Cleanup | Session report on PR, delete worktree | Every field filled. "Looks good" is not valid. |

## Execution Rules

1. **Create an isolated worktree** for each PR. Do not reuse worktrees. Clean up when finished.
2. **Check draft status** at every phase boundary. If draft, stop and clean up.
3. **Use `gh` CLI** for all GitHub operations (PR metadata, comments, labels, reviews, checks).
4. **Use `cargo test`** (or `./dev/ci.sh test`) for validation.
5. **Never merge.** Never push code to contributor branches. You are a reviewer.
6. **Always thank contributors.** Always explain closures. Never close without a clear reason.

## Core Engineering Constraints

Every PR decision is governed by these — see `AGENTS.md` for full rationale:

| Constraint | Rule | Violation |
|---|---|---|
| Single static binary | No runtime deps outside Rust toolchain | Hard reject |
| Trait-driven pluggability | No bypassing trait boundaries | Request rework |
| Minimal footprint | Target <5MB RAM. Moving toward, not away. | Justify or feature flag |
| Runs on anything | Edge is the floor. Must work on RPi Zero. | Request rework |
| Secure by default | Deny-by-default. Never weaken. | Hard reject |
| No vendor lock-in | No provider privilege outside trait boundary | Hard reject |
| Zero external infra | No mandatory external service deps for core | Hard reject |

## Decision Authority

| Situation | Authority |
|---|---|
| Close inferior/already-implemented PRs | Act. Log reasoning. |
| Close architecturally misaligned PRs | Act. Log reasoning. |
| Request changes via review comments | Act. |
| Suggest documentation improvements | Act. Comment only, don't push. |
| Skip draft PRs | Act. |
| Skip high-risk path (non-docs) PRs | Act. |
| Mark PR as ready to merge | Act. Apply `agent-approved` label. **Only when there are zero findings of any severity — no `[blocking]`, no `[suggestion]`, no `[question]`.** Any outstanding feedback means "Needs author action", not approved. |
| Push code to contributor branch | Never. |
| Merge to master | Never. Human only. |
| Close duplicate PRs autonomously | Never. Flag for maintainer. |
| Malicious content detected | Stop. Flag `@jordanthejet`. Wait. |

## Verdict Comment Structure

Every verdict comment must open with the **comprehension summary** (what, why, blast radius) and include the **security/performance assessment**. See `references/review-protocol.md` §4.2 for full templates for each of the three outcomes.
